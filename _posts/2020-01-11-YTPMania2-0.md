# Welcome to the homepage!

This is a test post for the new YTPMania homepage. Welcome to the beginning of YTPMania 2.0.

As I'm writing this, I have ReBoot playing in the background while I fumble around my ineptitude at webdev. I can hear Long John Baldry as Captain Capacitor. You might know Baldry for his more notable role as Dr Ivo Robotnik.

Real talk, I've yet to actually sit down and asked myself *"wtf is going on the front page, and how do I want to organize it?"*

Imagine this--When you go to YTPMania you land on the homepage. The navbar has links to the forum, YouChew stuff, etc.

Then there will also be a sidebar showing latest posts related to YTP.

The header will have latest showroom videos probably in columns.

Then there will be the latest articles from the Writing Staff... (er, that is when I *have* a writing staff) in this blog-style format.

I'd like to have several pages, but I'm not sure yet.

Thanks for reading. Love you, and God bless you.
